        Fish can swim, i as a human can not <p>
 <p>Fish can climb trees, i as a human can <p>

 <p>Fish can fly, i as a human can but with support <p>

 <p>So cat is the mighty, but fish! <p>

 <p>Even though they love water, but its the water itself that creates the illusion of fish can not do anything but swim. That’s not true and i am here to prove it <p>

 <p>I am a fish that can climb trees & hope to fly by itself one day! <p>
