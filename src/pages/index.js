        I'm Vuong Vu, a Front End developer working professionally for
        approximately 4 years. Throughout my work and learning, there're a lot
        of interesting things I've known and tried to remember, thing is, I
        always forget them and I keep searching for the same thing over and over
        again. However, I don't like writing blogs, I hate writing because it
        requires a lot of words.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when I know about this <strong>today-i-learned</strong> concept, I
        think it very suits me for some reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I want to have a place to note all the things I think it's
          interesting, not only tech but anything
        </li>
        <li>It doesn't require a lot of words</li>
        <li>I can practice writing English</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm happy that you're here :D.</p>
