        I'm Vuong Vu, a Front End developer working professionally for
        approximately 4 years. Throughout my work and learning, there're a lot
        of interesting things I've known and tried to remember, problem is, I
        always forget them as I keep searching for the same thing over and over
        again.
      </p>
      <p>
        So when I know about this{" "}
        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/todayilearned/">
          today I learned (til)
        </a>{" "}
        concept, I think it very suits me for some reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I want to have a place to note all interesting things, just for myself
        </li>
        <li>It doesn't require a lot of words like blogs</li>
        <li>I can practice writing English</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm happy that you're here{" "}
        <span role="img" aria-label="heart emoji">
