# Today I Learned

URL: https://til.vuongvu.me/

## Hey there üëã

I'm Vuong Vu, a Front End developer working professionally for approximately 4 years. Throughout my work and learning, there're a lot of interesting things I've known and tried to remember, problem is, I always forget them as I keep searching for the same thing over and over again.

So when I know about this `today I learned (til)` concept, I think it very suits me for some reasons:

- I want to have a place to note all interesting things, just for myself
- It doesn't require a lot of words like blogs
- I can practice writing English

I'm happy that you're here ‚ô•Ô∏è
