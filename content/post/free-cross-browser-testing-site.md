Here is it:

https://app.crossbrowsertesting.com

This site provides a free account that can let you test for quite a long time.

Startup time is very fast also, around 30s.

Can test locally, the setup is really easy.

Compare to the well-known BrowserStack, the crossbrowsertesting.com give you 5 minutes each testing session (should be enough for one test), BrowserStack only gives you 1 minute ðŸ‘Ž
